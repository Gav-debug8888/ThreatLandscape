| Thrill Seekers       | Not every threat actor is a skilled attacker. Many scripts, code repositories, and malware are freely downloadable for anyone to use. These threat actors are colloquially known as “thrill seekers” since they usually don’t have the technical skills to code or exploit vulnerabilities. Even without coding and hacking skills, script kiddies can still harm an organisation’s productivity and private data. A thrill seeker can also unknowingly add malware to the environment, thinking they are downloading tools they can control  | Fame, boredom or the thrill of disruptions  | DDOS Attacks and website defacement | Public websites, small businesses, personal websites and any site with weak security configurations | their aim is to no steal data but instead to disrupt or deface websites
| Hacktivists          | These threat actors use hacking techniques to promote political or social agendas, such as spreading free speech or uncovering human rights violations.
